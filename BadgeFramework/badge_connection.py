# This BadgeConnection interface represents a connection to an OpenBadge.
#
#      This connection is used by the Badge object to communicate with a physical badge.
#      This acts to bridge our abstraction of a badge to our implementation of
#      how we communicate with that badge.
#
#      This connection can be implemented by different subclasses using any
#      number of different libraries (Adafruit, BluePY, PYObjC) or communications
#      protocols (UART, BLE).
#
#    As long as a given implementation (subclass) implements these methods and follows
#    their specs, Badge() will be able to use that BadgeConnection to communicate with
#    a physical badge.
