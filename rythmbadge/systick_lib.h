/**@file
 * @details This module provides high accuracy timing for the application. 
 *			To synchronize the internal timestamps/millis the set-functions could be used.
 *			Internally the timing works with an app_timer at a low frequency (~100secs).
 *			When this timer expires an internal ticks_since_start-variable is incremented.
 *			The actual computation of the current milliseconds/timestamp is based on a 
 *			straightline equation:
 *			millis = millis_per_ticks * (cur_ticks - ticks_at_offset) + millis_offset.
 *			The parameters millis_per_ticks, ticks_at_offset and millis_offset are set initial in the init-function
 *			and are updated each time a synchronize set-function is called.
